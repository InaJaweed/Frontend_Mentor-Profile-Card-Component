### What I learned

I learnt how to position background image.

```css
background-image: url(/images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
	url(/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
background-position: left -180px bottom 350px, right -200px top 400px;
```

### Continued development

I need to understand this feature more and make it more responsive and fluid in positioning background images. Maybe learn css framework like bootstrap or tailwind to gain more experience.

### Useful resources
